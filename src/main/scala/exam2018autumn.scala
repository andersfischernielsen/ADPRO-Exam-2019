/************************************************************************
  Final Exam: Advanced Programming (Master-Level, MSc-Level)
  IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2018: 9 January 9:00

 ************************************************************************

  Your Full Name: Anders Fischer-Nielsen
  Your ITU email account: afin@itu.dk

  The exam consists of 10 tasks to  be solved within 4 hours.  MSc and
  Master students  (so all  registered) solve the  same exam,  all the
  tasks.   You  can  use  any  function  from  the  course  (textbook,
  exercises) in the solutions, as  well as standard library functions,
  unless stated otherwise in the question.  You can access any written
  or electronic  materials, also  online, but you  are not  allowed to
  communicate with anybody during the exam.

  By  submitting,  you declare  to  have  solved the  problems  alone,
  without communicating with anybody.



  SUBMISSION

  Solve the tasks in the file 'exam2018autumn.scala' (this file) found
  in the zip archive made available on LearnIt.

  Fill in your name and your ITU email above, in the top of the file.

  Submit this file  and only this file to learnIT.   Do not convert it
  to  any other  format than  .scala.  Do  not submit  the entire  zip
  archive. Do  not reorder  the answers,  and do  not remove  question
  numbers from the  file.  When free text answers  are expected, write
  them as comments.

  The only accepted file format is '.scala'.

  The  answers  will   be  graded  manually. We  will   focus  on  the
  correctness of ideas and the use  of the course concepts. We will be
  permissive on  minor issues  such as semicolons,  other punctuation,
  small deviations  in function  names, switching between  curried and
  uncurried  parameters, etc.   We  will not  check  whether the  type
  inference  succeeds. It suffices  that  a human  reader could  infer
  types.



  REMARKS

  Each  task has  some introduction  text. The part  that needs  to be
  solved is marked with the letter 'Q'.

  We do not recommend solving questions to the point when they compile
  and pass tests.  Dependency problems  and other technical issues can
  take a lot of time, so only do this, once you are done with drafting
  all answers.

  Nevertheless, if  you do compile,  you can use the  'build.sbt' file
  provided  in the  zip  archive linked  above. It  has the  necessary
  library dependencies  configured. The file also contains  the course
  libraries that the solutions depend on.

  Some values are made lazy  to prevent your executions failing before
  all exercises are  solved.  This is to help you  running in the REPL,
  or  testing otherwise.   Otherwise  these lazy  annotations have  no
  additional meaning.

  If possible, please keep the  code and comments wrapped at something
  like 80-120 columns. This helps grading a lot. For instance, observe
  the width of the original file.

  Good luck!

  /* Q. Explain in English why the above is the answer. In particular, first
   * describe (a) what does 'fn' do, then explain (b) in what way is the type
   * signature of 'fn' transformed in 'curry(fn)', and (c) is the semantics
   * of 'fn' different from 'curry(fn)' in other ways than the type signature?
   *
   * Indicative answer size (2-5 lines per point, not enforced strictly)
   *
   * (a) 
     - fn takes a function f and a function g and gives a triple (a, b, c).
     - f is a binary function, taking two integer parameters and returning 
       a function that takes an integer and returns an integer.
     - g is a function that given an integer returns an integer. 
     - (a, b) are the parameters that are passed to g in order to build the input to f. 
     - The function given by f is then applied using c from (a, b, c). 

   *
   * (b)
     curry takes a function f expecting two arguments and returns a function
     that instead can be partially applied by providing the first and then 
     at a later stage the second parameter. 
     It translates the function from taking multiple parameters and evaluating them 
     to being a series of single argument input/output functions. 
     It "unwraps" the parameters given to f, in other words. 
   *
   * (c) fn_curried can be partially applied, unlike fn (except for the triple). 
     Except for the parameters to the inner function f in fn and the triple 
     (a, b, c) all parameters to the function can now be given independently. 
     fn would have to be given both f and g and immediately evaluate the result 
     when given (a, b, c).

   *
   * where 'k' is the index of elements of the sequence (a natural number,

   * is a floating point division, and we need to produce a floating point
   * number, not an integer.
   *

   * in the head. This includes computing the values of s(k), for example by

   *  }
   *
   *  This interface is implemented by our FingerTrees in the course (and the
   *  FingerTrees module in this zip bundle has been slightly adjusted to make
   *  this interface explicit).
   *
   *  We want to obtain a new Deque implementation by combination: it takes two
   *  deques and presents them as a single one. For example it takes two Finger
   *  Trees and presents them as a single one.  The idea is to interleave the
   *  two incoming deques, taking elements from them, or putting into them in
   *  alternation.   So if you insert elements in sequence on the left, they are
   *  put interchangebly either in the first or the second combined deque.
   *  Similarly for removal.
   *
   *  Technically speaking this is a 'noisy' (fuzzy) deque because sometimes the
   *  elements may be leaving it in a slightly different order than they
   *  entered.  This may be fine for many applications though - so please ignore
   *  this issue in the exam.
   *
   *  For this we need to remember which one of the aggregated deques is active.
   *  We store it in the third parameter of the combinator constructor below
   *  (this.first_active). Initially the first argument deque is active,by
   *  default.
   *
   *  Study the implementation below until you reach the question text.

    /* Task 10. REASONING ABOUT DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN
     *
     * The above implementation uses one state variable (first_active) to store
     * which deque is active. First_active is switched approximately at every
     * operation. However this means that if we add and remove elements from the
     * combined deque in precise alternation, we will always be adding to one
     * deque, and always removing from the other (at least until it does not
     * deplete).  This is not a very interleaving strategy.
     *
     * One way to improve this, is to add another state variable to distinguish
     * which of the combined deques is active for adding, and which for removing
     * separately. Another way is to use randomization in selection of the queus
     * for operations.  Please choose the way you prefer, or propose another
     * one.
     *
     * Q. Describe in English what changes would be required to the above
     * implementation of head and tail functions to accommodate this change. Do
     * not write the implementations in Scala. The indicative answer size is
     * between 50 and 250 words (the size limit is indicative, so not enforced
     * in the grading). Include some assessment / justification of your design
     * choices.
     *
     * There is no single correct answer here.  The goal is to show how do you
     * approach the task of modifying a data structure design.
     *
     * Answer here: 
     * I would add and remove randomly to either queue simply because it's the
     * simplest change. With a proper random generator this would make the 
     * distribution of elements uniform between the queues. 
     * This would require only changing the first_active check in the pattern 
     * matching to be randNumber >= 0.5 instead of the boolean check-and-flip.
     *
     * Depending on the cost of checking the length of the two sub Deques, it 
     * might be feasible to instead check for how deep the sub Deques are and
     * add/remove depending on which one is the least/most full. This would
     * guarantee an equal distribution between the sub Deques.
